# Marksheet project

This is a sample project that creates a marksheet template that captures the subject marks for 3 students. The project accepts user input on: student number, student name, subject1, subject2, subject3, subject4, subject5 for each student. The program then computes the total as per a given screenshot. Additionally, the program calculates the average for each student and also computes the average for each of the unit at the bottom of each unit.
